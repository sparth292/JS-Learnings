What are the different data types in JavaScript?
JavaScript has several basic data types including string, number, boolean, undefined, null, symbol, and bigint. There are also complex data types like object, which includes arrays and functions.


How do you declare a variable in JavaScript?
In JavaScript, you can declare a variable using var, let, or const. let and const were introduced in ES6 and are preferred over var because of their block-scoping and other advantages.


What is the difference between let, var, and const in JavaScript?
var is function-scoped, while let and const are block-scoped. let allows you to reassign a value to a variable, while const does not, meaning variables declared with const cannot be reassigned after their initial assignment.


What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?
undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. null is an assignment value that represents “no value” or “empty”.


How can you check the data type of a variable in JavaScript?
You can use the typeof operator to determine the data type of a variable in JavaScript. For example, typeof 42 returns “number”, and typeof “hello” returns “string”.
